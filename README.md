# 📘 Internship Assignment Submission Guidelines

All interns must **strictly follow** the branching and folder structure below when submitting assignments.  
This ensures:

- Timely evaluation  
- Accurate skill-wise scoring  
- Better visibility throughout your internship tenure  

---

## ✅ Step 1: Create Your Branch

Create a new branch using your **Internship ID**.

**Branch format:**
INT-25-FS-2567

javascript
Copy code

> You will receive your Internship ID from the Ignite platform.

**Example command:**
```bash
git checkout -b INT-25-FS-2567
📁 Step 2: Create Weekly Folders
Inside your branch, create folders for each week:

python-repl
Copy code
week-1/
week-2/
week-3/
...
📂 Step 3: Create Day-wise Assignment Folders
Inside each week folder, create directories for each assignment using this format:

sql
Copy code
day-1-assignment-1/
day-1-assignment-2/
day-2-assignment-1/
...
Example folder structure:

sql
Copy code
INT-25-FS-2567/
└── week-1/
    ├── day-1-assignment-1/
    ├── day-1-assignment-2/
    └── day-2-assignment-1/
📤 Step 4: Submit Your Work
Place all your assignment files (code, documentation, screenshots, etc.) inside the appropriate folder.

Then commit and push your work:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Week 1 Day 1 Assignment 1 submission"
git push origin INT-25-FS-2567
⭐ Why This Structure Matters
Following this structure ensures:

✅ Faster and fair evaluation

✅ Accurate mapping of your work to skills

✅ Better visibility of your progress

✅ Stronger internship profile

✅ Improved final evaluation score
